            <p>Here are some books that I'm currently reading, have recently finished, or are otherwise relevant to my life right now! I've included some short reviews and recomendations below.</p>

                <h3><em>Algebra</em> – Michael Artin</h3>
                <p>I've been using this book to self-study Linear Algebra and Group Theory alongside my classes, and I will continue to use it to learn about Rings and Fields through Galois Theory. It's not a light read, but I would highly recomend picking up a copy (or finding a pdf) if you're beginning to study mathematics or any adjacent field. It's great to have on hand just to reference. A friend asked about an edge case of vector fields last night and I whipped it out to check the wordings of the axioms. If you don't like math, don't get this book, but it's 10/10 for a nerd like me.</p>

            <section id="another_country">
                <h3><em>Another Country</em> – James Baldwin</h3>
                <p>Fantastic, devastating, and nuanced, as expected from James Baldwin. My contender for the Great American Novel, but if you want an uplifting story, look elsewhere.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="fictions">
                <h3><em>Collected Fictions</em> – Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
                <p>I've been reading a short story or two from this book before bed. These are some of the most creative stories I've ever read.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="geb">
                <h3><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> – Douglas Hofstadter</h3>
                <p>I went into a book store a few weeks ago not intending to buy anything, but temptation got the best of me as usual. Music, art, and math all in one 800 page, pulitzer-winning volume? I couldn't not buy it. I feel like it was written with people exactly like me in mind.</p>
                <p>I'm currently making my way through this book and I love it. The writing style is conversational and engaging but does not shy away from getting deep into the little nerdy details of each topic discussed. Every other chapter is a dialogue between achilles and a turtle, which serves to introduce new ideas in a fun way before they're explored more formally.</p>
                <p>I don't think any real mathematical knowledge is required to enoy this book, as long as you're interested in the subject. I'm really enjoying this book so far. 11/10.</p>

            <section id="complexity">
                <h3><em>Notes on Complexity</em> – Neil Theise</h3>
                <p>I read this book the summer of 2024, right before beginning college, and it made me confident that I had made the right choice in becoming a math major. It's one of those books I wasn't able to stop thinking about (or talking about) for months after finishing it because it put so many things into a new and fascinating light. When I got to college, I made my friend <a href="https://henhen1227.com">Henry</a> read it just so I'd have someone to talk to about complex systems.</p>
                <p>I've been flipping through it again recently because the topics discussed turn out to be relevant to my current research. This is a fantastic (and quick) read that requires no mathematical background whatsoever. It discusses complexity in a philosophicl light. Topics range from factals to Kurt Gödel to Zen Buddhism. I would reccomend this book to everyone. (and by now, I just about have)</p>
