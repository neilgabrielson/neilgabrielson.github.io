                    <h3><em>Algebra</em> – Michael Artin</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been using this book to self-study Linear Algebra and Group Theory alongside my classes, and I will continue to use it to learn about Rings and Fields through Galois Theory.
                        It's not a light read, but I would highly recomend picking up a copy (or finding a pdf) if you're beginning to study mathematics or any adjacent field.
                        It's great to have on hand just to reference.
                        A friend asked about an edge case of vector fields the other night and I whipped it out to check the wordings of the axioms.
                        If you don't like math, don't get this book, but it's 10/10 for a nerd like me.
                    </p>

                <section id="another_country">
                    <h3><em>Another Country</em> – James Baldwin</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fantastic, devastating, and nuanced, as expected from James Baldwin.
                        This book has a whole cast of characters, which it uses to dissect a wide range of deeply human relationships, and one man who sits at the intersection of the struggles that they all face.
                        It's an interesting reflection on romantic relationships, their inherent struggles, the way that society can amplify them, and the burden of intersectionality. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's the kind of story that you keep digesting long after you turn the last page.
                        My contender for the Great American Novel, but if you want an uplifting story, look elsewhere.

                <section id="fictions">
                    <h3><em>Collected Fictions</em> – Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been reading a short story or two from this book most nights before bed.
                        The first collection, <i>A Universal History of Iniquity</i>, tells the stories of a number of villains, loosely or not-so-loosely inspired by real historical figures.
                        <i>Fictions</i> is a collection of metafictional book reviews that dive into some wild philosohpical themes. I particularly enjoyed <i>Tlön, Uqbar, Orbus Tertius</i>.
                        I've read a couple of good stories from <i>The Aleph</i>, particularly "The House of Asterion," which is fantastic, particularly for how short it is.

                <section id="geb">
                    <h3><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> – Douglas Hofstadter</h3>
                    <p>
                        I went into a book store a few weeks ago not intending to buy anything, but temptation got the best of me as usual.
                        Music, art, and math all in one 800 page, pulitzer-winning volume? I couldn't not buy it.
                        I feel like it was written with people exactly like me in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently making my way through this book and I love it.
                        The writing style is conversational and engaging but does not shy away from getting deep into the little nerdy details of each topic discussed.
                        Every other chapter is a dialogue between achilles and a turtle, which serves to introduce new ideas in a fun way before they're explored more formally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't think any real mathematical knowledge is required to enoy this book, as long as you're interested in the subject.
                        I'm really enjoying this book so far. 11/10.

                    <h3><em>Notes on Complexity</em> – Neil Theise</h3>
                    <p>
                        I read this book the summer of 2024, right before beginning college, and it made me confident that I had made the right choice in becoming a math major.
                        It's one of those books I wasn't able to stop thinking about (or talking about) for months after finishing it because it put so many things into a new and fascinating light.
                        When I got to college, I made my friend <a href="https://henhen1227.com">Henry</a> read it just so I'd have someone to talk to about complex systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've was flipping through it again recently because the topics discussed turned out to be relevant to my summer research.
                        This is a fantastic (and quick) read that requires no mathematical background whatsoever.
                        It discusses complexity in a philosophicl light. Topics range from factals to Kurt Gödel to Zen Buddhism.
                        I would reccomend this book to everyone. (and by now, I just about have)

                <section id="pale_fire">
                    <h3><em>Pale Fire</em> – Vladimir Nabokov</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is an excellent piece of metafiction, written in the form of a 1000 line poem by the fictional poet John Shade with long and rambling annotations by the entertainingly unreliable narrator Charles Kinbote.
                        It was kindly lent to me by Hayden Jasper Roman Marquardt-Grainer.
