                    <h3>Fractal Plotter</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a fun, interactive fractal plotter that I made using Javascript, Canvases, and WebGL.
                        You can explore 6 different variations of the Mandelbrot set with 6 custom colormaps.
                        Side-by-side panes let you see the relationship between these fractals and the corresponding Julia sets at each point.
                        You can iterate points in the Julia set to see their orbits either approach a cycle or escape to infinity.
                        Fractals can be rendered on the GPU for speed or on the CPU for deep zoom precision.

                    <h3>Text Editor</h3>
                    <p>
                        I recently began working on a text editor.
                        It currently supports markdown and will eventually have built-in LaTeX and Git support.
                        It's intended to be a minimalist, distraction-free tool aimed at creative writers, with simple styling and powerful version contol.
                        I'm building it with Electron and ReactJS.

                    <h3>Mini Golf</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a 3D mini golf game that I made a very long time ago, but it holds up better than most of my old projects.
                        I made the game in Unity with C# and created all of the models myself in Blender.
                        Regrettably, I also made the music. It's truly awful. Apologies.

                    <h3>Sailboat</h3>
                    <p>
                        I built a 14ft sailboat during the COVID lockdown.
                        It's made out of plywood, 2x4s stripped down for the gunwales, chines, and keel, fiberglass tape over the seams, a lot of caulk, and several layers of blue maritime paint.
                        My grandma helped sew the sail from sailcloth.
                        My dad helped with some of the woodworking and all the two-man jobs, like bending the sides in and clamping them on both ends.
                        It turns out building a boat is mostly sanding!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This boat has no centerboard or leeboard, and the rigging is very simple.
                        As a result, it doesn't like to go very far upwind.
                        Last time I took it out, I landed a couple beaches downwind from where I left.
                        However, it doesn't leak and it's very stable.
                        For its flaws as a sailboat, it makes an excellent rowboat!
