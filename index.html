                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am an undergraduate student studying mathematics at <a href="https://northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>. I'm currently participating in a summer research project studying pattern formation PDEs. (see more on my <a href="/research.html">research page</a>) I also do peer tutoring for several courses, so if you need help in a math class at Northeastern, look for me on Knack!</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, playing jazz guitar, and reading. I hope to read a lot this summer while I have the time and chronicle it on my <a href="/books.html">what I'm reading</a> page. I'm a big fan of coffee. I also enjoy visiting the Museum of Fine arts to sketch, study, or just look at the exhibits. I keep a stack of ticket stubs on my desk and it just keeps growing!</p>
                <p>I really like traveling and learning about new places. I live in Boston, MA for school, but I'm from Cape Elizabeth, Maine, I've spent time in Seville, Spain, and I look forward to studying math in Budapest, Hungary later this summer. I speak English fluently and Spanish okay. I've studied French, but I can't speak it at all. Maybe I'll pick up some Hungarian while I'm abroad.</p>
