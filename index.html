                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student studying mathematics at Northeastern University. 
                    This past summer, I worked on an REU research project studying pattern formation PDEs.
                    You can see more about it on my <a href="research.html">research page</a>.
                    I also went on a <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/08/08/math-heritage-hungary-northeastern-dialogue/">Dialogue of Civilizations</a>  to study math in Budapest, Hungary, which was a blast.
                    I do peer tutoring for several courses at Northeastern, so if you're a student struggling with a math class, please look for me on Knack!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy hiking, paddling, playing guitar, and reading.
                    I occasionally share what I've been reading on the aptly titled <a href="/books.html">what I'm reading</a> page of this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a big fan of caffeine.
                    I drink black pourover coffee at home, but my café order is a cortado.
                    I've also been getting into yerba mate recently.
                    I like the ability to refill the gourd as much as I like, and it's nice to sip through a bombilla.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will frequently find me at the Museum of Fine arts, sketching, studying, or just looking at the exhibits.
                    I collect ticket stubs from the museum, noting who I went with and what I saw.
                    The stack of ticket stubs on my desk keeps getting taller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love traveling and learning about new places.
                    I'm live in Boston, MA for school, but I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Maine.
                    I also lived in Seville, Spain for a year in high school and I recently spent a month in Budapest, Hungary.
                    I speak Spanish well enough to get by when I'm in Spain.
                    I studied French in high school, but any attempt I make at speaking it is an insult to the language.
                    The only Hungarian words are sziasztok, köszönöm, and puszi puszi.
                    I learned the Hungarian numbers 1-31 at one point so that I could play cribbage, but I can't recall them now.
